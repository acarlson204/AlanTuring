    <h1>Alan Turing</h1>

    <h2>Turing c. 1928 at age 16</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Mathison Turing (1912 â€“ 1954)</a>
      </strong>
      was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician,
      cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing is widely
      considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and
      artificial intelligence. Turing was highly influential in the
      development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation
      of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine,
      which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer...which we
      now just call a computer.

    <h2>Bletchley Park</h2>
    <p>
      During the Second World War, Turing worked for the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCHQ#Government_Code_and_Cypher_School">Government Code
        and Cypher School</a>
      at
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park" target="_blank">Bletchley Park</a>,
      Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a
      time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval
      cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the
      breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish
      bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for
      the Enigma machine.

    <h2>Bombe</h2>

    <p>
      Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that
      enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements,
      including the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic
      " target="_blank">
        Battle of the Atlantic</a>. Due to the problems of counterfactual history, it is hard to
      estimate
      the precise effect Ultra intelligence had on the war, but it has been
      estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two
      years and saved over 14 million lives.

    <h2>The Automatic Computing Engine</h2>
    <p>
      After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where
      he designed the Automatic Computing Engine. The Automatic Computing
      Engine was one of the first designs for a
      <strong> stored-program computer</strong>. In 1948, Turing joined Max
      Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of
      Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became
      interested in mathematical biology. <br><br>He wrote a paper on the chemical
      basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such
      as the Belousovâ€“Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s.
      Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts; the Labouchere
      Amendment of 1885 had mandated that "gross indecency" was a criminal
      offence in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES,
      [to continue working] as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954,
      16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning.

    <h2>Statue of Turing at Bletchley Park</h2>
    <p>
      Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised in his home
      country during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the
      Official Secrets Act. In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British
      Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of
      the British government for "the appalling way he was treated". <br><br>Queen
      Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013. The "Alan
      Turing law" is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom
      that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical
      legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. <br><br>Turing has an extensive
      legacy with statues of him, many things named after him including an
      annual award for computer science innovations. He is due to appear on
      the Bank of England Â£50 note, to be released in June 2021.
      <br />
      <br />
      A 2019 BBC series, as voted by the audience, named him the
      <strong>greatest person of the 20th century.</strong>
